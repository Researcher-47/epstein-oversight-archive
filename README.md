Document-based reconstruction and analysis of the House Oversight Epstein archive.


# Epstein Oversight Archive

This repository contains a structured, document-based reconstruction of the
publicly released House Oversight Committee archive relating to Jeffrey Epstein.

The goals of this project are to:

- Organize the archive into machine-readable tables.
- Document identity resolution and entity-linking logic.
- Map communication chains and forwarding paths.
- Characterize the "negative space" (who and what does *not* appear).
- Provide reproducible methods so others can repeat or extend the analysis.

All conclusions in the associated reports are derived directly from the
released documents. No speculation is included.
